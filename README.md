# home-assistant-config
My home assistant config running on a Raspberry Pi 3.

To get started on your own setup head to the [Home Assistant website](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) to get started. I recommend using the Hass.io image for the easiest way to get up and running.


*NB I make used of the HomeKit component and use the Home app for automations and scenes. It makes live easier having them easily editable by my wife through her the Home app on her phone.*

## Device List:
* Nest Thermostat V3
* Nest Indoor Camera
* Hue Bridge
    * Hue Color Lights
    * Hue White Lights
    * Hue Light Strip
* TP Link Plugs
* iPhone (x2 wife and I)
* Apple TV

I also make use of voice assistants not configured in Home Assistant
* Apple HomePod
* Amazon Echo

## Remote Access
I use port forwardning and DuckDNS for remote access to home assistant and using the app on my iPhone.

The Home Assistant docs are really good for this - [https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/remote/](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/remote/)
